# Tic-tac-toe Game

(Part of [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) challenges)


A simple [Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game made using Jade(Pug), Sass (with bootstrap 4), and JavaScript (with jQuery). <br>
Start by choosing your side (X starts the game), then try to place three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to win the game.<br>
When the game ends, either by winning, tie or loosing, you can play again, over and over again.<br>
Hope you'll have some fun!
